Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a Quantum Research Data Scientist at [Center for Computational Life Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/research/computational-life-sciences).
I am a physicist by training, with a Ph.D. from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/).
I work on interesting quantum computing problems in physics and life sciences.
Beyond my [research](/research/), I am passionate about other emerging science and tech fields. 
Sometimes I write stuff on my [blog](/blog/).
<!-- I am a PhD candidate at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), researching on spintronics in topological materials as well as quantum computing.  -->
