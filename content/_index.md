Hi there! I am a PhD candidate at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), researching on spintronics in topological materials as well as quantum computing. Beyond my [research](/research/), I also have broad interests in emerging fields of science and technology. I hope to share interesting discoveries and insights (mostly in science) in my [blog](/blog/).
