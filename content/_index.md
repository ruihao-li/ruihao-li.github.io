Hi! I am a PhD candidate studying the spintronic aspects of topological materials at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/), including novel nonlinear transport phenomena, spin-charge conversion, etc. In addition to my current [research](/research/), I also have broad interests in emerging fields of science and technology, particularly quantum computing. You can see my recent experiences of quantum computing in some of my [blog posts](/blog/).
