Hi! I am a PhD candidate studying the spintronic aspects of topological materials at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), including novel nonlinear transport phenomena, spin-charge conversion, etc. In addition to my current [research](/research/), I also have broad interests in emerging fields of science and technology, particularly quantum computing. 

<!-- I am documenting some of my experiences in these areas on my [blog](/posts/) (*to appear soon*). -->
