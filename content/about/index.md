## A Brief Bio

Welcome! My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in [Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong). When I started my undergraduate study at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent around 6 months at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) as an exchange student when I was in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to high energy physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Michael Schmidt](https://michael.cai-schmidt.org/) on a project about [quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms](/files/Honours_Thesis.pdf), which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After graduation, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. [Pavel Fileviez Perez](https://fileviez.com/) on the theory of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. [Shulei Zhang](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/shulei-zhang/) on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as `Mathematica`, `Python`, `Julia`, etc. See my [research](/research/) for more details.

## Other Interests

  - I am passionate about quantum computing, particularly the applications of quantum machine learning. I use mostly [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) (I am [Qiskit-certified](/files/IBM_Certified_Associate_Developer.pdf)!) and [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/). :atom:
  - I occasionally contemplate quantitative finance with tools like [Zipline](https://github.com/quantrocket-llc/zipline) and [Moonshot](https://github.com/quantrocket-llc/moonshot). :chart_with_upwards_trend:
  - I am a huge fan of basketball, the [NBA](https://www.nba.com/), and LeBron James. :crown:
  - I turn into an avid cook from time to time. :shallow_pan_of_food:
