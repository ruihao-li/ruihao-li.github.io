## A Brief Bio

Welcome! My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in [Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong). When I started my undergraduate study at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent two quarters at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) as an exchange student in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Michael Schmidt](https://michael.cai-schmidt.org/) on [quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms](/files/Honours_Thesis.pdf), which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After that, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. [Pavel Fileviez Perez](https://fileviez.com/) on theories of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. [Shulei Zhang](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/shulei-zhang/) on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as `Mathematica`, `Python`, `Julia`, etc. See my [research](/research/) for more details.

Since late 2021, I have become more serious about one of my other passions, quantum computing. My main interests include exploring quantum machine learning as well as simulation of physical systems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. I have been actively engaged in activities related to quantum computing, where I benefited a lot from getting exposed to cutting-edge research problems in both industry and academia, as well as interacting with experts and fellow students. Here are some highlights:

- 02/22: I became [Qiskit-certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/d8b2f9bb-6e08-410c-89e2-cf98be2cbdd3?source=linked_in_profile)! 
- 02/22: I completed all the coding challenges in [QHack 2022](/files/QHack_Coding_Challenge_Certificate.pdf) hosted by Xanadu.
- 04/22: I took part in the 24-hour [QC Hack 2022](/files/QCHack2022_Certificate.pdf) Hackathon and together with four other teammates, we built a prototype of the quantum snakes-and-ladders game and won one of the [Honorable Mentions](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/winners-2022) in the IBM Quantum Challenge.
- 04/22: I was selected as one of the mentees for the [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) and began working on a project on QAOA.
- 05/22: I completed the [IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022](https://www.credly.com/badges/717d9647-4f1e-46c7-8972-79153902efc6?source=linked_in_profile), which I wrote a series of blog posts about. See: [part I](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-1/), [part II](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-2/), and [part III](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-3/).
- 06/22: I worked as a Quantum Algorithms Research Intern at [Agnostiq](https://agnostiq.ai/) during summer 2022.
- 08/22: I became a [Qiskit Advocate](https://www.credly.com/badges/53d49104-e640-4c64-a3ea-cd5557665499?source=linked_in_profile)!
- 09/22: I was selected as a mentee for the [Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22) and began working on [Qiskit QEC](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-qec).
