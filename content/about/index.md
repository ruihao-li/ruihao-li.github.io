## A Brief Bio

Welcome! My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in [Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong). When I started my undergraduate study at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent around 6 months at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) as an exchange student when I was in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to high energy physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Michael Schmidt](https://michael.cai-schmidt.org/) on a project about [quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms](/files/Honours_Thesis.pdf), which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After graduation, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. [Pavel Fileviez Perez](https://fileviez.com/) on the theory of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. [Shulei Zhang](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/shulei-zhang/) on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as `Mathematica`, `Python`, `Julia`, etc. See my [research](/research/) for more details.

Since late 2021, I have become more serious about one of my other passions, quantum computing. I am mainly interested in exploring quantum machine learning and optimizations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In Spring 2022 I took a graduate course on quantum computing (PHYS 486) at CWRU. I have also been actively involved in many events related to quantum computing, where I benefited a lot from getting exposed to cutting-edge research problems in both industry and academia, as well as interacting with experts and fellow students. Here are some of the highlights as of June 2022:

- I have become [Qiskit-certified](https://www.credly.com/badges/d8b2f9bb-6e08-410c-89e2-cf98be2cbdd3?source=linked_in_profile)!
- I completed all the coding challenges in [QHack 2022](/files/QHack_Coding_Challenge_Certificate.pdf) hosted by Xanadu.
- I took part in the 24-hour [QC Hack 2022](/files/QCHack2022_Certificate.pdf) Hackathon and together with four other teammates, we built a prototype of the quantum snakes-and-ladders game and won one of the [Honorable Mentions](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/winners-2022) in the IBM Quantum Challenge.
- I completed the [IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022](https://www.credly.com/badges/717d9647-4f1e-46c7-8972-79153902efc6?source=linked_in_profile), which I wrote a series of blog posts about. See: [part I](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-1/), [part II](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-2/), and [part III](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-3/).
- I was selected as one of the mentees for the [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) in March 2022.
- I am now working as a Quantum Algorithms Research Intern at [Agnostiq](https://agnostiq.ai/).
