## A Brief Bio

Welcome! My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in [Guangdong, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong). I received my Bachelor's degree with First Class Honours in physics from [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) (Australia) in 2016. I also spent two quarters at [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://ucsd.edu/) as an exchange student during 2014 - 2015. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Michael Schmidt](https://michael.cai-schmidt.org/) on [quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms](/files/Honours_Thesis.pdf), which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After that, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at [Case Western Reserve University (CWRU)](https://case.edu/) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. [Pavel Fileviez Perez](https://fileviez.com/) on theories of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. [Shulei Zhang](https://physics.case.edu/faculty/shulei-zhang/) on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as `Mathematica`, `Python`, `Julia`, etc. See my [research](/research/) for more details.

Besides my current PhD research, I also have a strong interest in quantum computing (QC). My main interests lie in exploring quantum simulation of physical systems (e.g., many-body physics) and quantum machine learning with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Recently, I have been involved in a few projects on QC:

- I am currently working on a review and benchmarking of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), as part of the [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) (2022.4 - present).
- I worked as a Quantum Algorithms Researcher summer intern at [Agnostiq](https://agnostiq.ai/) in 2022, focusing on developing non-trivial variational algorithms for novelty/anomaly detection (2022.5 - 2022.8).
- I implemented some functionality of the [XP stabilizer formalism](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-09-22-815/) in [Qiskit QEC](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-qec), a new open-source framework for quantum error correction, as part of the [Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22) (2022.9 - 2022.12).


See other QC-related activities I have participated in [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-hao-li/details/certifications/). 

<!-- - 04/22: I took part in the 24-hour [QC Hack 2022](/files/QCHack2022_Certificate.pdf) Hackathon and together with four other teammates, we built a prototype of the quantum snakes-and-ladders game and won one of the [Honorable Mentions](https://www.quantumcoalition.io/winners-2022) in the IBM Quantum Challenge.
- 04/22: I was selected as one of the mentees for the [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF) Mentorship Program](https://qosf.org/qc_mentorship/) and began working on a project on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).
- 05/22: I completed the [IBM Quantum Spring Challenge 2022](https://www.credly.com/badges/717d9647-4f1e-46c7-8972-79153902efc6?source=linked_in_profile), which I wrote a series of blog posts about. See: [part I](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-1/), [part II](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-2/), and [part III](/blog/ibm-spring-challenge-3/).
- 06/22: I worked as a Quantum Algorithms Research Intern at [Agnostiq](https://agnostiq.ai/) during summer 2022, researching on non-trivial variational algorithms for novelty detection.
- 08/22: I became a [Qiskit Advocate](https://www.credly.com/badges/53d49104-e640-4c64-a3ea-cd5557665499?source=linked_in_profile)!
- 09/22: I was selected as a mentee for the [Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22) and began working on the implementaion of the [XP stabilizer formalism](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-09-22-815/) in [Qiskit QEC](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-qec).
- 11/22: I completed the [IBM Quantum Fall Challenge 2022](https://www.credly.com/badges/d7e759b1-1dd2-4587-b1f2-9251b19434ac/linked_in_profile), where I learned about the recently released Qiskit Runtime primitives. -->
