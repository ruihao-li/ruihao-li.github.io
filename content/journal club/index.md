Starting from Spring 2022, I am co-organizing a Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Journal Club at CWRU. Currently we are having biweekly meetings where two speakers will present their papers of choice. We are hosting the meetings both in-person and over Zoom. If you are interested in joining or want to present a recent CMP paper of your own, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:rxl527@case.edu) for more details.

Below are the papers presented so far:
