## Overview

My current PhD research focuses on the investigation of novel spin/charge transport phenomena in topological materials. Specifically, topological semimetals, such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals, are three-dimensional topological phases with gapless excitations. Due to the interplay of their unique topology and symmetries, they exhibit topologically protected boundary excitations---[Fermi arc states](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07310) for Weyl semimetals and [higher-order Fermi arc (HOFA) states](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00016) for Dirac semimetals---as well as interesting phenomena like the chiral anomaly, which manifests in novel transport responses such as the [negative magnetoresistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1627) and the [nonlinear Hall effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10887) proposed in one of our works. More details can be found in this [review article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01111).

I have also worked on Dirac and Majorana dark matter models that establish a possible connection between baryon number violation and dark matter phenomenology. See publications below for more details.
