My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in Guangdong, China. When I started my undergraduate study at The University of Sydney in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent around 6 months at University of California San Diego (UCSD) as an exchange student when I was in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to high energy physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Michael Schmidt on a project about quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms, which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After graduation, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. Pavel Fileviez Perez on the theory of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. Shulei Zhang on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as Mathematica, Python, Julia, etc. See my research for more details.\nOther Interests #  I am passionate about quantum computing, particularly the applications of quantum machine learning. I use mostly Qiskit (I am Qiskit-certified!) and PennyLane. ⚛ I occasionally contemplate quantitative finance with tools like Zipline and Moonshot. 📈 I am a huge fan of basketball, the NBA, and LeBron James. 👑 I turn into an avid cook from time to time. 🥘  ","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"2017.8 - present \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp; **Ph.","title":"About"},{"content":"Starting from Spring 2022, I am co-organizing a Condensed Matter Physics (CMP) Journal Club at CWRU.

Overview # My current research focuses on the investigation of novel spin/charge transport phenomena in topological materials. Specifically, topological semimetals, such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals, are three-dimensional topological phases with gapless excitations. Due to the interplay of their unique topology and symmetries, they exhibit topologically protected boundary excitations\u0026mdash;Fermi arc states for Weyl semimetals and higher-order Fermi arc (HOFA) states for Dirac semimetals\u0026mdash;as well as interesting phenomena like the chiral anomaly, which manifests in novel transport responses such as the negative magnetoresistance and the nonlinear Hall effect proposed in one of our works. More details can be found in this review article.\nI have also worked on Dirac and Majorana dark matter models that establish a possible connection between baryon number violation and dark matter phenomenology.
