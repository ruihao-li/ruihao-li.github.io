[{"content":"  A quick peek at the shell interface.  This weekend I spent some time tweeking the Terminal on my Mac with iTerm2 and Fish shell. Why did I do it? First of all, I have been quite fed up with the boring black-and-white look of the default Terminal app. In my opinion, the introduction of multiple colors together with glyphs/icons not only makes it look better visually, it also helps one distinguish different contents (e.g. directories, files) more easily. Moreover, I just want more customizations and features like autosuggestions to make working with command lines a little more efficient. So below are the ingredients I used to customize my Terminal and instructions for some key steps.\nIngredients: #  iTerm2: A popular terminal emulator for macOS  Colors: I personally use Solarized Dark  Download Solarized Unzip and double click on the the color scheme Solarized Dark.itermcolors under the directory /iterm2-colors-solarized Open iTerm2\u0026rsquo;s Preferences → Profiles → Colors, and select the theme under Color Presets   Text: We need one of the Nerd Fonts to render the glyphs/icons; I chose two of them  Meslo Nerd Font: Downloaded from the Tide repo; this particular font contains all the glyphs needed Source Code Pro Nerd Font: Installed on Homebrew via brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts (only need to run this once) and then brew install --cask font-source-code-pro; This is the font I\u0026rsquo;d like to use in text Alternatively, all the Powerline Fonts can be installed based on this repo Go to iTerm2\u0026rsquo;s Preferences → Profiles → Text, under Font, choose Source Code Pro (for Powerline) or any font you like; select Use a different font for non-ASCII text, then choose MesloLGS NF under Non-ASCII Font   I also resize the New Windows to be 120 columns and 40 rows under the Window panel   Fish shell: A great alternative to bash and zsh  Installation: brew install fish Set fish as the default shell:  Add the shell to /etc/shells with echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells Change the default shell with chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish   Oh My Fish: Package manager for customizing the fish shell  Check all the themes contained in Oh My Fish: omf theme I installed the Agnoster theme: omf install agnoster Apply the theme: omf theme agnoster   Fisher: Plugin manager for fish  See all the plugins and prompts here     Exa: Replacement for ls  Installation: brew install exa Customized ll and lla:  Find fish config file (config.fish) in ~/.config/fish Add the following lines to the config file (I got this trick from the great Takuya Matsuyama): if type -q exa alias ll \u0026#34;exa -l -g --icons\u0026#34; alias lla \u0026#34;ll -a\u0026#34; end       OK, there you go. I will update this post in the future if there are new elements added to my Terminal customization.\n","date":"May 8, 2022","permalink":"/blog/fish-shell-customization/","section":"Blog","summary":"A quick peek at the shell interface.","title":"Fish Shell and Customization"},{"content":"2017.8 - present \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp; **Ph.D. in Physics**, *Case Western Reserve University*, USA. 2013.3 - 2016.11 \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp; **B.Sc.

My name is Ruihao Li (李瑞浩). I grew up in Guangdong, China. When I started my undergraduate study at The University of Sydney in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent around 6 months at University of California San Diego (UCSD) as an exchange student when I was in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to high energy physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Michael Schmidt on a project about quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms, which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After graduation, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. Pavel Fileviez Perez on the theory of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. Shulei Zhang on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as Mathematica, Python, Julia, etc. See my research for more details.\nOther Interests #  I am passionate about quantum computing, particularly the applications of quantum machine learning. I use mostly Qiskit (I am Qiskit-certified!) and PennyLane. ⚛ I occasionally contemplate quantitative finance with tools like Zipline and Moonshot. 📈 I am a huge fan of basketball, the NBA, and LeBron James. 👑 I turn into an avid cook from time to time. 🥘  ","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"2017.8 - present \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp; **Ph.","title":"About"},{"content":"Title: Impact of the Fermi Arc Diversity on the Berry Curvature Dipole in Time Reversal Invariant Weyl Semimetals\nAuthors: Diego García Ovalle - Armando Pezo - Aurélien Manchon (Aix-Marseille Université, CNRS, CINaM, Marseille, France.)\nAbstract:\nWhereas anomalous Hall effect has been thought to only exist in materials presenting a net magnetization, such as ferro- or ferrimagnetic metals, recent progress has revealed that this is not the case. In particular, it has been recently proposed that in nonmagnetic crystals a transverse Hall current can develop at the second order in the electric field. This effect, tagged the nonlinear Hall effect, arises in certain non-centrosymmetric crystals and is driven by the Berry curvature dipole. Weyl Semimetals are particularly promising platforms for the observation of the nonlinear Hall effect because their bulk Fermi surface is composed of Weyl nodes with diverging Berry curvature. Nonetheless, Weyl Semimetals display another intriguing aspect that has remained scarcely addressed so far. Depending on the Weyl cone inclination, their surface feature a wide variety of trivial and non-trivial states, including Fermi pockets, arcs and track states.\nIn this work, adopting a model for noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal, we investigate the impact of these surface states on the nonlinear Hall response. We show that depending on the slab geometry, surface states can have a dramatic impact on the nonlinear Hall effect, resulting in substantial thickness-dependence. We also extend our study to the realistic case of WTe2 thin film using a Wannier-projected tight-binding representation. Finally, we mention the intimate connection that is expected between the nonlinear Hall effect and the Orbital Edelstein Effect of these noncentrosymmetric materials.\n","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/journal-club/dgo_abstract/","section":"Journal Club","summary":"Title: Impact of the Fermi Arc Diversity on the Berry Curvature Dipole in Time Reversal Invariant Weyl Semimetals","title":"Journal Club"},{"content":"  Some Weyl cones and Feynman diagrams.  Overview # My current research focuses on the investigation of novel spin/charge transport phenomena in topological materials. Specifically, topological semimetals, such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals, are three-dimensional topological phases with gapless excitations. Due to the interplay of their unique topology and symmetries, they exhibit topologically protected boundary excitations\u0026mdash;Fermi arc states for Weyl semimetals and higher-order Fermi arc (HOFA) states for Dirac semimetals\u0026mdash;as well as interesting phenomena like the chiral anomaly, which manifests in novel transport responses such as the negative magnetoresistance and the nonlinear Hall effect proposed in one of our works. More details can be found in this review article.\nI have also worked on Dirac and Majorana dark matter models that establish a possible connection between baryon number violation and dark matter phenomenology.
