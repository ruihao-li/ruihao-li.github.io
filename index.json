My name is Ruihao Li (ÊùéÁëûÊµ©). I grew up in Guangdong, China. When I started my undergraduate study at The University of Sydney in 2013, I aspired to be a molecular biologist. I spent around 6 months at University of California San Diego (UCSD) as an exchange student when I was in my second year, after which my academic interest gradually shifted to high energy physics. In my final undergraduate year, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Michael Schmidt on a project about quantum corrections in left-right symmetric seesaw mechanisms, which are theoretical models for explaining neutrino masses. After graduation, I began to pursue my Ph.D. in physics at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in 2017. I spent the first two years working with Dr. Pavel Fileviez Perez on the theory of leptophobic dark matter models. Starting from 2019, I have been working with Dr. Shulei Zhang on charge and spin transport in topological quantum materials, especially topological semimetals. I make use of both analytical and numerical tools for my research, such as Mathematica, Python, Julia, etc. See my research for more details.\nOther Interests #  I am passionate about quantum computing, particularly the applications of quantum machine learning. I use mostly Qiskit (I am Qiskit-certified!) and PennyLane. ‚öõ I occasionally contemplate quantitative finance with tools like Zipline and Moonshot. üìà I am a huge fan of basketball, the NBA, and LeBron James. üëë I turn into an avid cook from time to time. ü•ò  ","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"2017.8 - present \u0026ensp;\u0026ensp; **Ph.","title":"About"},{"content":"Title: Impact of the Fermi Arc Diversity on the Berry Curvature Dipole in Time Reversal Invariant Weyl Semimetals\nAuthors: Diego Garc√≠a Ovalle - Armando Pezo - Aur√©lien Manchon (Aix-Marseille Universit√©, CNRS, CINaM, Marseille, France.)\nAbstract:\nWhereas anomalous Hall effect has been thought to only exist in materials presenting a net magnetization, such as ferro- or ferrimagnetic metals, recent progress has revealed that this is not the case. In particular, it has been recently proposed that in nonmagnetic crystals a transverse Hall current can develop at the second order in the electric field. This effect, tagged the nonlinear Hall effect, arises in certain non-centrosymmetric crystals and is driven by the Berry curvature dipole. Weyl Semimetals are particularly promising platforms for the observation of the nonlinear Hall effect because their bulk Fermi surface is composed of Weyl nodes with diverging Berry curvature. Nonetheless, Weyl Semimetals display another intriguing aspect that has remained scarcely addressed so far. Depending on the Weyl cone inclination, their surface feature a wide variety of trivial and non-trivial states, including Fermi pockets, arcs and track states.\nIn this work, adopting a model for noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal, we investigate the impact of these surface states on the nonlinear Hall response. We show that depending on the slab geometry, surface states can have a dramatic impact on the nonlinear Hall effect, resulting in substantial thickness-dependence. We also extend our study to the realistic case of WTe2 thin film using a Wannier-projected tight-binding representation. Finally, we mention the intimate connection that is expected between the nonlinear Hall effect and the Orbital Edelstein Effect of these noncentrosymmetric materials.\n","date":"January 1, 1","permalink":"/journal-club/dgo_abstract/","section":"Journal Club","summary":"Title: Impact of the Fermi Arc Diversity on the Berry Curvature Dipole in Time Reversal Invariant Weyl Semimetals","title":"Journal Club"},{"content":"  Some Weyl cones and Feynman diagrams.  Overview # My current research focuses on the investigation of novel spin/charge transport phenomena in topological materials. Specifically, topological semimetals, such as Weyl and Dirac semimetals, are three-dimensional topological phases with gapless excitations. Due to the interplay of their unique topology and symmetries, they exhibit topologically protected boundary excitations\u0026mdash;Fermi arc states for Weyl semimetals and higher-order Fermi arc (HOFA) states for Dirac semimetals\u0026mdash;as well as interesting phenomena like the chiral anomaly, which manifests in novel transport responses such as the negative magnetoresistance and the nonlinear Hall effect proposed in one of our works. More details can be found in this review article.\nI have also worked on Dirac and Majorana dark matter models that establish a possible connection between baryon number violation and dark matter phenomenology.
